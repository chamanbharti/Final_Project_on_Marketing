The code is seperated across two python scripts; the frist script creates plot 1 and the second script creates plot 2. 
The Shell script which describes how to use the python scripts, is named MarketingProject.sh, and can be found in the 
doc directory. It can be opened through Git Bash with a simple text editor by typing: nano MarketingProject.sh. When calling
the shell script you must make sure you are in the directory that the shell script is located, otherwise you must provide 
the filepath.
