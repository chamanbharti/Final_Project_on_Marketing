# This script explains how python scripts are called, and how arguments 
# are passed to the python scripts 

# 2 input arguments are required: 
# The first input argument is the name of the dataframe you want to import in ' '. 
# The second input argument is the sheetname in which the data is located: sheetname = '  '.
